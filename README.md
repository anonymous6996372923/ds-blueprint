## Abstract 

As the demand for jobs in data science increases, so does the demand for universities to develop and facilitate modernized data science curricula to train students for these positions. Yet, the development of these courses remains challenging, espeically at the introductory level. To help instructors to meet this demand, we present a flexible blueprint that supports the development of a modernized introductory data science curriculum. This blueprint is narrated through the lends and experience in teaching the introductory data science course at UNIVERSITY. This is a large course that serves both STEM and non-STEM majors and includes the incorportation and facilitation of technologies such as R, SRstudio, Quarto, Git, and GitHub. We identify and provide discussion aroudn common challenges in teaching a modernized introductory data science course, detail a learning model for students to grow their understanding of data science concepts, and provide reproducible materials to help empower teahcers to adopt and adapt such curriculum at their universities. 

## About This Repository 

This repository contains reproducible material to help create, develop, and modernize your own introductory to data science course. 

-- A scaffolded in-class exercise (and the solutions) on tidying data can be found in the *ae-example* folder above

-- An example prepare video to a lesson on tidying data can be found [here: redacted author created video](--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux85eR3h9hw) This is a 7-minute video that goes through what tidy data are, in depth. 

-- Example code to invite students into your GitHub organization, and distribute individual repositories to students can be found in the *github-classroom* folder above

-- The Data Science in a Box curriculum can be found [here](https://datasciencebox.org/hello)

## More Information 

If you want more information on how to distribute individual or team assessments to your students, or want information to help you configure GitHub and RStudio, please click [here: redacted author created resource](--https://rundel.github.io/ghclass/articles/ghclass.html). This resource helps individuals with course management using the ghclass package in R. There are many code examples and a FAQ section that makes this a great resource for those first starting to use such a package.
